                sContent: '<h3>INTRODUCTION: -</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>An epidemic of lower back pain affects millions of individuals globally. One significant cause of this pain stems from disc problems in the lumbar spine, such as disc herniations, degeneration, or nerve impingement. To accurately diagnose these disc issues, healthcare professionals rely on various physical assessments. Among the most reliable tests is the Slump Test.</p><h3>What is the Slump Test?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a physical examination technique used to assess neural tension, particularly in the lumbar spine. It’s often employed by physiotherapists, chiropractors, and physicians to evaluate nerve root compression or disc pathologies. When someone has pain radiating from their lower back into the legs, known as sciatica, the Slump Test can provide valuable insights into whether a lumbar disc problem is the source of the pain.</p><p>Why is the Slump Test Important for Lumbar Spine Disc Diseases? Disc diseases in the lumbar spine, such as herniated or bulging discs, can compress the spinal nerves. This compression leads to a range of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, particularly down the legs. The Slump Test helps in pinpointing the source of these symptoms, especially when they are related to nerve involvement due to disc displacement.</p><p>The test mimics a slouched posture, which stretches the spinal cord and nerve roots. If a disc problem exists, this stretch aggravates the pain or discomfort, confirming the involvement of lumbar disc issues.</p><h3>How is the Slump Test Performed?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is typically done in a clinical setting. Here’s how it works:<br /><ul><li><p>Patient Position: The patient sits on the edge of the examination table with their thighs supported, knees flexed, and feet dangling.</p></li><li><p>Posture Slumping: The patient is asked to slump or round their back while keeping their head upright. This posture places stress on the spinal structures.</p></li><li><p>Neck Flexion: The patient is then instructed to flex their neck by bringing the chin toward the chest.</p></li><li><p>Leg Extension: With the patient in this slumped position, one leg is slowly extended by the clinician, which stretches the sciatic nerve and the nerve roots in the lumbar spine.</p></li><li><p>Response Assessment: The patient is asked if they feel any reproduction of their symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or tingling down the leg. If so, it indicates the likelihood of lumbar nerve root irritation, often due to a disc herniation or other disc pathology.</p></li></ul></p><h3>Interpretation of Results:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Positive Test: If the patient experiences a reproduction of their typical symptoms, particularly sciatica-like pain, while performing the test, it’s considered a positive result. This strongly suggests neural involvement due to lumbar disc issues.</p><p>Negative Test: If the patient does not experience any symptoms or discomfort, the result is negative. This could indicate that the disc is not the cause of the pain, or that the symptoms are stemming from other sources like muscular tension or joint dysfunction.</p><h3>Clinical Relevance of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a useful tool in diagnosing lumbar disc problems because it reproduces the mechanical stresses that occur when the lumbar spine’s nerve roots are irritated. It provides valuable direction to clinicians in determining the next steps for treatment, including physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustments, or even more invasive interventions like injections or surgery.</p><h3>Limitations of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Although the Slump Test is valuable, it’s not the only tool for diagnosing lumbar disc disease. It must be combined with other assessments such as:</p><p>MRI or CT scans to confirm disc herniations or degenerations. Range of motion tests to rule out joint-related issues. Reflex testing to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement. Additionally, the Slump Test is a subjective test based on the patient’s response, so it requires skilled interpretation from the clinician.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a crucial direction-providing test in diagnosing disc diseases of the lumbar spine. It helps clinicians assess nerve root compression due to disc herniation or bulging, which is often the source of lower back pain radiating down the legs. As part of a comprehensive physical assessment, the Slump Test can offer clear guidance for treatment strategies, ultimately helping patients recover from lumbar spine issues and regain their quality of life.</p><p>For anyone experiencing lower back pain or sciatica-like symptoms, consult a healthcare provider to assess the possibility of disc-related problems using diagnostic tools like the Slump Test. Early detection can lead to more effective treatments and a quicker recovery.</p>'

According to research, elderly men&#39;s and women&#39;s immunological responses to influenza vaccine vary significantly.</p><p>Hormonal differences between men and women have a significant role in these discrepancies. Estrogen, which is found in greater amounts in women, has been demonstrated to improve immunological response to vaccinations, particularly flu injections. According to studies, women may have a stronger immunological response to vaccination than males because of hormonal influences.</p><p>Furthermore, age-related immune system changes, known as immunosenescence, influence how older people respond to immunizations. In general, older persons have a weakened immune system, which leads to a worse response to vaccination. However, research suggests that women may maintain greater immune function as they age than males, perhaps leading to a more effective response to flu vaccines.</p><p>In addition, variations in the way older men and women react to flu vaccines might be attributed to hereditary factors. It is known that individual reactions to vaccination are influenced by differences in genes linked to immune function and vaccine response. Variations in vaccination effectiveness between older men and women have been identified; these discrepancies may be partially explained by genetic differences.</p><p>In summary, whereas vaccinations against influenza protect against the disease for older men and women alike, there are notable variations in the immune responses of these populations. Comprehending these distinctions is crucial for refining vaccination plans for senior citizens and creating specialized methods to increase vaccination efficacy in this demographic.</p>'

Poor core strength is considered to be one of the leading causes of low back pain and injuries associated with sport specific performances. The aim of this study was to establish whether there was a significant difference in the lumbar core strength of skaters, when compared to that of age matched non-skaters. Measures should be taken towards achieving a good core strength as a pre-emptive as well as a curative step against low back pain, among skater and the general population not participating in any sport specific performance</p><p>Aims & Objectives: This study sought to assess and compare the lumbar core strength of skaters and non-skaters. Study design: Observational study</p><p>Methodology: A total of 100 participants were selected, 50 skaters and 50 non-skaters, between the ages of 15 to 25 years. The skaters were those who had a minimum of 1 year training without any complaints of low back pain, fracture, etc. and non-skaters were individuals who did not participate in any other form of training. The pressure bio-feedback method was explained to all the participants. Their consent was obtained. The core strength of the participants was then assessed and compared using Unpaired t-Test in Microsoft excel 2007.</p><p>Results: After comparing the data, it was found that the mean core strength of the skaters (case group) was 6.12 ± 1.99, and that of the non-skaters (control group) was 4.56 ± 2.28. The p value obtained was 0.00, which implied that there was a significant difference between the two groups, with the case group having greater core strength value.</p><p>Conclusion: Thus, it was found that, statistically, the lumbar core muscle strength of the case group i.e. skaters was significantly more than that of the control group i.e. non-skaters.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Lumbar core, strength, skaters, adolescence, adult</p>",

There seems to be a prevalence of neck pain in these throwing athletes which correlate with these shoulder rotational range changes.</p><p>Materials and Methods: This is an observational study. 70 overhead throwing athletes were recruited for this study. Materials used were a standard goniometer and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) Questionnaire. The shoulder rotational ranges were measured by a goniometer in supine position. The dominant and non-dominant ranges were compared to determine the differences. Neck pain assessment by using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) was done. Shoulder rotational ranges and NDI were correlated using the Spearman’s Correlation test.</p><p>Results: Significant differences were found in the rotational ranges of dominant and non-dominant shoulder. Out of 70, 42 athletes were found to demonstrate mild disability due to neck pain. The internal rotational deficit had a moderate positive correlation with NDI (r= 0.364, p= 0.01). Also, the Total Range of Motion (TROM) deficit had a moderate positive correlation with the NDI (r= 0.538, p=0.01). No correlation between External Rotation difference and NDI was found.</p><p>Conclusion: There is a prevalence of mild disability due to neck pain in throwing athletes. Internal Rotation deficit and a reduced Total Range of motion have a significant correlation with NDI in throwing athletes.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Throwing athletes; internal rotation deficit; neck pain</p>",
