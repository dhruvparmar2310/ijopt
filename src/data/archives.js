                sContent: '<h3>INTRODUCTION: -</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>An epidemic of lower back pain affects millions of individuals globally. One significant cause of this pain stems from disc problems in the lumbar spine, such as disc herniations, degeneration, or nerve impingement. To accurately diagnose these disc issues, healthcare professionals rely on various physical assessments. Among the most reliable tests is the Slump Test.</p><h3>What is the Slump Test?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a physical examination technique used to assess neural tension, particularly in the lumbar spine. It’s often employed by physiotherapists, chiropractors, and physicians to evaluate nerve root compression or disc pathologies. When someone has pain radiating from their lower back into the legs, known as sciatica, the Slump Test can provide valuable insights into whether a lumbar disc problem is the source of the pain.</p><p>Why is the Slump Test Important for Lumbar Spine Disc Diseases? Disc diseases in the lumbar spine, such as herniated or bulging discs, can compress the spinal nerves. This compression leads to a range of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, particularly down the legs. The Slump Test helps in pinpointing the source of these symptoms, especially when they are related to nerve involvement due to disc displacement.</p><p>The test mimics a slouched posture, which stretches the spinal cord and nerve roots. If a disc problem exists, this stretch aggravates the pain or discomfort, confirming the involvement of lumbar disc issues.</p><h3>How is the Slump Test Performed?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is typically done in a clinical setting. Here’s how it works:<br /><ul><li><p>Patient Position: The patient sits on the edge of the examination table with their thighs supported, knees flexed, and feet dangling.</p></li><li><p>Posture Slumping: The patient is asked to slump or round their back while keeping their head upright. This posture places stress on the spinal structures.</p></li><li><p>Neck Flexion: The patient is then instructed to flex their neck by bringing the chin toward the chest.</p></li><li><p>Leg Extension: With the patient in this slumped position, one leg is slowly extended by the clinician, which stretches the sciatic nerve and the nerve roots in the lumbar spine.</p></li><li><p>Response Assessment: The patient is asked if they feel any reproduction of their symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or tingling down the leg. If so, it indicates the likelihood of lumbar nerve root irritation, often due to a disc herniation or other disc pathology.</p></li></ul></p><h3>Interpretation of Results:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Positive Test: If the patient experiences a reproduction of their typical symptoms, particularly sciatica-like pain, while performing the test, it’s considered a positive result. This strongly suggests neural involvement due to lumbar disc issues.</p><p>Negative Test: If the patient does not experience any symptoms or discomfort, the result is negative. This could indicate that the disc is not the cause of the pain, or that the symptoms are stemming from other sources like muscular tension or joint dysfunction.</p><h3>Clinical Relevance of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a useful tool in diagnosing lumbar disc problems because it reproduces the mechanical stresses that occur when the lumbar spine’s nerve roots are irritated. It provides valuable direction to clinicians in determining the next steps for treatment, including physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustments, or even more invasive interventions like injections or surgery.</p><h3>Limitations of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Although the Slump Test is valuable, it’s not the only tool for diagnosing lumbar disc disease. It must be combined with other assessments such as:</p><p>MRI or CT scans to confirm disc herniations or degenerations. Range of motion tests to rule out joint-related issues. Reflex testing to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement. Additionally, the Slump Test is a subjective test based on the patient’s response, so it requires skilled interpretation from the clinician.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a crucial direction-providing test in diagnosing disc diseases of the lumbar spine. It helps clinicians assess nerve root compression due to disc herniation or bulging, which is often the source of lower back pain radiating down the legs. As part of a comprehensive physical assessment, the Slump Test can offer clear guidance for treatment strategies, ultimately helping patients recover from lumbar spine issues and regain their quality of life.</p><p>For anyone experiencing lower back pain or sciatica-like symptoms, consult a healthcare provider to assess the possibility of disc-related problems using diagnostic tools like the Slump Test. Early detection can lead to more effective treatments and a quicker recovery.</p>'

However, the risk of injuries is always present due to the high-intensity nature of the game. To address this issue, FIFA developed the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, aimed at reducing the risk of injuries among soccer players of all levels.</p><p>The FIFA 11+ program consists of a series of exercises designed to improve strength, balance, agility, and flexibility while also targeting key risk factors for injuries, such as incorrect movement patterns and muscle imbalances. By incorporating these exercises into their regular training routine, players can significantly reduce their chances of sustaining common injuries like muscle strains, ligament tears, and sprains.</p><p>The FIFA 11+ program emphasizes dynamic stretching and muscle activation exercises to prepare the body for soccer matches, increasing flexibility, improving proprioception, and reducing injury risk.</p><p>In addition to the physical benefits, the FIFA 11+ program also emphasizes the importance of good technique and proper body mechanics to prevent injuries. By teaching players how to move efficiently and safely on the field, the program helps reduce the risk of overuse injuries and repetitive strain.</p><p>Overall, the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program is effective in reducing the incidence of injuries among soccer players. By incorporating this program into their training regimen, players can improve their performance on the field while also safeguarding against the physical toll that the sport can take on their bodies. Whether you&#39;re a professional athlete or a casual player, following the FIFA 11+ program can help keep you healthy, strong, and injury-free while playing the beautiful game of soccer.</p>'

According to research, elderly men&#39;s and women&#39;s immunological responses to influenza vaccine vary significantly.</p><p>Hormonal differences between men and women have a significant role in these discrepancies. Estrogen, which is found in greater amounts in women, has been demonstrated to improve immunological response to vaccinations, particularly flu injections. According to studies, women may have a stronger immunological response to vaccination than males because of hormonal influences.</p><p>Furthermore, age-related immune system changes, known as immunosenescence, influence how older people respond to immunizations. In general, older persons have a weakened immune system, which leads to a worse response to vaccination. However, research suggests that women may maintain greater immune function as they age than males, perhaps leading to a more effective response to flu vaccines.</p><p>In addition, variations in the way older men and women react to flu vaccines might be attributed to hereditary factors. It is known that individual reactions to vaccination are influenced by differences in genes linked to immune function and vaccine response. Variations in vaccination effectiveness between older men and women have been identified; these discrepancies may be partially explained by genetic differences.</p><p>In summary, whereas vaccinations against influenza protect against the disease for older men and women alike, there are notable variations in the immune responses of these populations. Comprehending these distinctions is crucial for refining vaccination plans for senior citizens and creating specialized methods to increase vaccination efficacy in this demographic.</p>'

Poor core strength is considered to be one of the leading causes of low back pain and injuries associated with sport specific performances. The aim of this study was to establish whether there was a significant difference in the lumbar core strength of skaters, when compared to that of age matched non-skaters. Measures should be taken towards achieving a good core strength as a pre-emptive as well as a curative step against low back pain, among skater and the general population not participating in any sport specific performance</p><p>Aims & Objectives: This study sought to assess and compare the lumbar core strength of skaters and non-skaters. Study design: Observational study</p><p>Methodology: A total of 100 participants were selected, 50 skaters and 50 non-skaters, between the ages of 15 to 25 years. The skaters were those who had a minimum of 1 year training without any complaints of low back pain, fracture, etc. and non-skaters were individuals who did not participate in any other form of training. The pressure bio-feedback method was explained to all the participants. Their consent was obtained. The core strength of the participants was then assessed and compared using Unpaired t-Test in Microsoft excel 2007.</p><p>Results: After comparing the data, it was found that the mean core strength of the skaters (case group) was 6.12 ± 1.99, and that of the non-skaters (control group) was 4.56 ± 2.28. The p value obtained was 0.00, which implied that there was a significant difference between the two groups, with the case group having greater core strength value.</p><p>Conclusion: Thus, it was found that, statistically, the lumbar core muscle strength of the case group i.e. skaters was significantly more than that of the control group i.e. non-skaters.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Lumbar core, strength, skaters, adolescence, adult</p>",

Although it seems reasonable that even minor biomechanical alterations in the support surface may influence postural-control strategies. Flexible flatfoot is defined as the postural appearance of the foot, with depressed medial longitudinal arch, pronated subtalar joint and the calcaneus assuming a valgus position underweight bearing conditions. The term “flexible” means that while the foot is flat when standing (weightbearing), the arch returns when not standing. Dynamic balance is the ability of an object to balance while in motion. Y balance test is useful tool to measure dynamic balance which measures dynamic balance in three different directions, anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral direction.</p><p>Method: 10 subjects with bilateral flexible flat feet as assessed by sit to stand navicular drop test and 10 subjects with normal arched feet both in the age group 18-25 years were chosen for the study. The sample size therefore was 40 feet (20 flat feet and 20 normal arched feet). Group A (n= 10) subjects was individuals with flatfeet and group B (n= 10) subjects was individuals with normal arched feet. All the subjects were asked to perform Y – Balance test. Subjects were asked to keep their non-testing leg on the center of the grid. Subjects was asked to reach in all three directions (anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral) by great toe of testing leg as much as he can. Distance covered by the subjects in all three direction was recorded. Then same procedure was repeated for another leg. Data analysis was done by the Unpaired -'t' test using SPSS software version 20.</p><p>Result: There was no significant difference found between flatfeet and normal arched feet.</p><p>Conclusion: Dynamic balance is not affected in flat feet individuals.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Dynamic balance; Flat feet; Sit to stand navicular drop test; Y- balance test.</p>",

The attacks are accompanied by salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, nasal mucosa congestion, skin redness, facial swelling and/or contraction of the muscles acting on jaw. It is also characterized by regions of increased arousal, called trigger zones.There is gamut of medical and surgical treatment modalities available for trigeminal neuralgia, with other treatment methods like physiotherapy, acupuncture and psychological methods.5To control pain in patients with TN,carbamazepine should be offered and oxcarbazepine,baclofen,lamotrigine and pimozide may be considered6Physiotherapy is one of the methods to treat TN ,pain control is usually achieved by means of electrical stimulation .The two currents most often used to achieve this intention are pulsed current usually referred as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS) and burst modulated medium frequency alternating current in the form of interferential current(IFC). Efficacy of TENS and IFC on Trigeminal Neuralgia have been studied separately but studies on comparison are not available. So present study was taken up with the purpose of comparing efficacy of TENS and IFC on trigeminal neuralgia Both TENS and IFC has significant efficacy in case of Trigeminal Neuralgia when studied separately.

In this study, attitudes& perceptions of students pursuing their Bachelors in Physiotherapy in two urban cities of Maharashtra have been studied and their views regarding choosing physiotherapy as a career highlighted; as they are the best ones to judge this rather than other professionals doing it for them. There is no doubt that Physiotherapy as a course, career and even as a profession is scaling new heights & reaching peaks.</p><p>Aims & Objectives: This study sought to assess the attitude and beliefs of Bachelors of PT students regarding the future of their profession in India.</p><p>Study design: Questionnaire based survey</p><p>Methodology: A self prepared questionnaire & Google docs format of the questionnaire was distributed to 9Physiotherapy colleges in Pune & Mumbai. The sample size was 737. The questionnaire consisted of 14 single best response MCQs.</p><p>Results: After analyzing the data received, it was seen that 87% students decided to study physiotherapy after their low medical entrance exam scores. 76% also sought advice from professional career counselors before choosing PT. Students also believed that this field has its disadvantages and not many were aware about the job opportunities in & around their state. Students appeared to have a mixed opinion about whether licensing exam should be compulsory before practicing physiotherapy in India.</p><p>Conclusion: Awareness about physiotherapy as a career is increasing but still needs to be worked upon mainly at school levels and amongst the general population.

At a higher level game, being a fast paced sport Badminton demands excellent fitness, aerobic stamina, strength, speed and precision. Playing Badminton also requires good agility, cardiovascular endurance, strength and reaction time. Reaction time is the amount of time taken to respond to a stimulus. It can be improved by practice as it affects the quality of game. Every player and healthcare professionals need to analyze the technique and requirement of the sport in order to modulate the coaching accordingly.</p><p>Aim: To find if there is a correlation between upper extremity muscles strength of dominant hand and reaction time in competitive badminton players.</p><p>Material and Method: Isometric muscle strength of pectoralis major, shoulder rotators, triceps, deltoid, wrist flexors and extensor were assessed using the hand-held dynamometer (FET3) and the reaction time was assessed by audiovisual reaction time machine for competitive badminton players. The average age was 18.77 (± 2.75) years. Both the parameters were correlated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient test using Microsoft Excel 2007.</p><p>Result: A negative moderate correlation was found between the upper extremity muscle strength and reaction time.

The relationship among these factors with neck pain was examined.</p><p>Results: The study indicated high prevalence rate of non-specific chronic neck pain (51.7%). Neck pain was strongly associated with functional disability in surgeons (p= 0.000). Stress factors were associated with functional disabilities in surgeons (p=0.000).</p><p>Conclusion: These results indicate that non-specific chronic neck pain does affect the functional disability in surgeons. Strong association of stress factors on the functional disabilities in surgeons was confirmed, while associated factors don’t contribute to the functional disabilities in surgeons. There is high recommendation of urgent ergonomic attention and physiotherapeutic awareness for the future.</p><p>Keywords: non-specific chronic neck pain; perceived stress; functional disability</p>",

Even small improvements in the areas of mobility, balance, and gait may contribute valuable benefits in terms of quality of life. Footwear, being at the interface between the body and the supporting surface, has the potential to affect balance and subsequently, the risk of falling. Hence the purpose of this study was to evaluate the balance & gait while wearing different type of footwear using functional reach test (FRT), time up and go test(TUG) and 10 meter walk test(10 MWT).</p><p>Subjects: 50 older males aged between 60-80 years.</p><p>Method: Demographic data, brief history and characteristics of different type of footwear were recorded. Each subjects performed FRT, TUG and MWT while barefoot, walking shoe and usual footwear (slipper). Each subject had performed all 3 tests without any difficulty. Three trials were given for each test and average of three trials was noted by therapist. One way repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analysis were done by SPSS.</p><p>Results: One way repeated measure ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between each footwear condition for all 3 tests. Post-hoc analysis revealed that walking shoes were having significant superior score than the barefoot & usual footwear for all 3 tests.</p><p>Conclusion: Walking shoes improve balance and gait in older males. Walking shoes also provide shock absorption and allow people to walk faster without increasing the impact loading of the body. So Footwear intervention should be considered as a way of improving gait and balance in older males.</p><p>Keywords: Different footwear; Balance; Gait.</p>",

Therefore, innovative rehabilitation programs are preferred. This study aims to check the effect of RehabRelive Active glove therapy in improving hand function in stroke survivors. A prospective, interventional study was conducted in patients with subacute and chronic stroke patients. 24 participants were allocated to the experimental group or the control group. The experiment group underwent 45 minutes of conventional physical therapy plus 15 minutes of glove therapy, and 5 minutes of conventional hand treatment. The control group underwent 45 minutes of conventional physical therapy plus 20 minutes of conventional hand therapy. All participants underwent each intervention 4 days/week for four weeks. They were evaluated before and 4 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the change in the score of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (wrist and hand component) and the secondary outcome measures were the box and block test, and Chedoke arm and hand activity inventory. Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the outcome measures of both groups. Results of this study showed that RehabRelive glove therapy showed improvement in all outcome measures, which confirms the efficacy of glove therapy. However, there is no statistically significant difference found in comparison of the intervention group with the control group. RehabRelive active glove therapy is feasible, safe, and without adverse effects, providing an entertaining approach to rehabilitation.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> RehabRelive Active Glove, Conventional therapy, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, Hand dexterity</p>",

It leads to pain, stiffness, and reduced cervical mobility. IASTM and IC are used for myofascial release, limited research compares their immediate effects. This study aims to provide evidence on the best technique for reducing pain and improving cervical ROM.</p><p><strong>AIM & OBJECTIVE:</strong> To study the immediate effects of IASTM versus IC on pain by NPRS and ROM by digital goniometer in college students with upper trapezitis.</p><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> 30 participants selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were divided into two groups: Group A received IASTM and Group B received IC. Both groups received a hot pack before treatment and active cervical spine exercises post-treatment. The subjects were evaluated using the NPRS and Digital-goniometer at pre and post-treatment intervals.</p><p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in pain and improvements in ROM. However, between-group comparisons revealed no significant difference in pain reduction (IASTM: 3.46 ± 0.55 vs. IC: 3.47 ± 0.75; p = 1). IASTM resulted in significantly greater improvement in ROM (Left: 6.91 ± 0.68 vs. 2.97 ± 0.78; p = 0.000021, Right: 6.58 ± 0.08 vs. 3.65 ± 0.02; p = 0.000013).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Both IASTM and IC were effective in reducing pain and improving cervical range of motion in students with trapezitis.

It affects cervical as well as thoracic postures in individuals using smartphones. Cervical posture changes lead to forward head posture and thoracic posture changes lead towards forward position of the scapula and shoulder. Muscle activity changes are seen in sternocleidomastoid and middle trapezius muscles while texting. The clinical examination is directed towards to assess postural changes by photogrammatic examination for various postural angles such as craniovertebral angel (CVA), Sagittal head tilt, Coronal head tilt etc. Ergonomic modifications will help to prevent the further injury to spine.

The cervical flexion-rotation test (CFRT) is highly reliable for diagnosing cervicogenic headache. PNF techniques help improve posture, strengthen cervical flexors, and reduce pain. Suboccipital relaxation targets muscle fatigue and decreases headache severity. This study compares the effects of PNF and suboccipital relaxation on pain and neck disability in CGH patients.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique versus suboccipital relaxation exercise on pain and neck disability among patients with cervicogenic headache.</p><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Participants with a positive cervical flexion-rotation test were randomly assigned into two groups using the sealed envelope method. Group A received PNF and Group B received suboccipital relaxation exercises for 60 minutes/day, 4 days/week for 4 weeks.

TR offers cost-effective and convenient solutions while empowering patients to take control of their home-based therapy, fostering patient autonomy. It particularly benefits underserved communities, enhances treatment frequency, and improves therapist-patient interaction through digital platforms. TR proves especially valuable for elderly, pediatric, and musculoskeletal care populations, increasing exercise adherence and supporting remote monitoring with personalized care delivery. However, TR faces significant challenges in performing physical assessments and manual techniques, limiting its effectiveness compared to in-person therapy. Inconsistent outcomes and lower patient satisfaction, particularly for conditions such as dementia, raise concerns about feasibility and clinical acceptance.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> While TR demonstrates significant potential for expanding healthcare access and improving patient autonomy, addressing limitations in physical assessment capabilities and patient satisfaction remains crucial for widespread clinical acceptance.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Telerehabilitation, Telemedicine, COVID-19 pandemic, Remote healthcare, Physical therapy</p>",

Neck pain, muscular imbalances, and reduced deep neck flexor(DNF) function might arise from the head projecting forward from the ideal position. The sub-occipital muscles, which hold the head posture, have an affinity to become hyperactive in an FHP. The immediate effects of sub-occipital release on neck pain, Cranio-Vertebral Angle(CVA) and DNF activation among young adults with FHP was the purpose of this study.</p><p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> A pre-post experimental study was conducted with 25 young adults(ages 18–26) diagnosed with FHP(defined by a craniovertebral angle <50°). Participants received a standardized 5-minute sub-occipital release intervention. Key outcomes—pain(Numeric Pain Rating Scale), DNF activation(pressure biofeedback), and CVA(Kinovea software)—were assessed before and after the intervention.</p><p><strong>RESULT:</strong> Non-parametric analysis supported the findings related to pain and muscle activation. Following the intervention, the participants reported a notable improvement in pain reduction (p=0.0001) and DNF activation(p=0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant change in CVA(p=0.285).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> A single session of sub-occipital release significantly reduced neck pain and improved DNF activation in individuals with FHP.

In the case of soccer players, the static dynamic balance are important factors. By the deficiency of the static and dynamic balance they may get more injured. The feet are the only body segments that come into direct contact with the ground surface, especially during weight bearing and gait. When their anatomical and sensorial structure is intact, with no joint or soft tissue changes, they contribute to the maintenance of postural stability. Variations in foot posture also one of the factors that will affect the balance.Some studies shows that postural stability is affected by foot type under both static and dynamic conditions. Screening of the athletes by using FPI to identify risk of injury related to balance problems is important to prevent future serious injuries.</p><p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS: </strong>Recreational soccer players with BMI between 18–24 were selected from football academies. After obtaining informed consent, each participant underwent the following assessments: Foot Posture Index (FPI) to classify foot posture. Static balance assessed by the Stork Balance Test (both limbs). Dynamic balance assessed by the Y-Balance Test (both limbs). Data were analyzed using correlation statistics.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Right Foot: FPI vs Static Balance: Significant negative correlation (r = -0.364) FPI vs Dynamic Balance: Non-significant negative correlation (r = -0.006). Left Foot: FPI vs Static Balance: Significant negative correlation (r = -0.404), FPI vs Dynamic Balance: Non-significant negative correlation (r = -0.047)</p><p><strong>DISCUSSION: </strong>The results suggest that an abnormal foot posture, as indicated by FPI, negatively impacts both static and dynamic balance. Significant findings with static balance highlight the potential role of foot alignment in postural control.

While diagnostic and treatment protocols have improved, the non-respiratory consequences of TB—such as sleep disturbances and fatigue remain under-addressed, despite their substantial impact on recovery, quality of life, and treatment adherence.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>This study aimed to assess sleep quality and fatigue levels in individuals with pulmonary TB and to determine the correlation between these two variables.</p><p><strong>METHODS: </strong>A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases (TBCD) Ward of Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad. Fifty-six participants diagnosed with pulmonary TB for over three months were evaluated. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and fatigue levels were assessed using the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS-12). Descriptive statistics and Pearson/Spearman correlation tests were used to analyse the data.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Participants had poor sleep quality (mean PSQI = 15.64) and moderate to high fatigue (mean PFS = 6.22). Among them, 73.2% experienced moderate fatigue and 26.8% had severe fatigue. A statistically significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.515, p < 0.01) was found between sleep quality and fatigue levels. Disease duration showed a strong positive correlation with poor sleep (ρ = 0.866) and moderate correlation with fatigue (ρ = 0.441), highlighting a progressive impact.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Poor sleep and significant fatigue are highly prevalent in pulmonary TB patients and are strongly correlated. These findings emphasize the need for routine screening and integrative management strategies including sleep hygiene education, fatigue interventions, and psychological support.

This syndrome can lead to a variety of symptoms, lower back pain, leg weakness, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, saddle anaesthesia and reduced functional mobility. Timely intervention is essential to optimize outcomes, but neglected cases pose a unique challenge in rehabilitation. This subject a 65-year-old female, presented with numbness and weakness of bilateral lower limbs with low back pain on and off for the past 15 years which worsened for the past two years leading to complete loss of bladder and bowel control and weakness of the lower limb muscles with loss of sensation of bilateral foot and saddle anaesthesia pattern. The subject had undergone decompression discectomy L4-L5 with posterior lumbar inter body fusionL4-L5, but due to a delayed intervention, neurological deficits persisted. A comprehensive physiotherapy management program was implemented, including Electrical Stimulation, core stabilization exercises, lower limb strengthening exercises, gait training, and bladder and bowel retraining. Over an eight weeks’ period, the patient demonstrated significant improvements in motor power in lower limbs, bladder bowel function and functional mobility and quality of life. This single case study brings lights on physiotherapy management on a neglected case of CES after decompression and stabilization prognosis is good and the patient can have a better quality of life. Physiotherapy intervention appeared to play a crucial role in enhancing the patient's overall well-being.</p>",

Neck pain, muscular imbalances, and reduced deep neck flexor(DNF) function might arise from the head projecting forward from the ideal position. The sub-occipital muscles, which hold the head posture, have an affinity to become hyperactive in an FHP. The immediate effects of sub-occipital release on neck pain, Cranio-Vertebral Angle(CVA) and DNF activation among young adults with FHP was the purpose of this study.</p><p><strong>METHODOLOGY: </strong>A pre-post experimental study was conducted with 25 young adults(ages 18–26) diagnosed with FHP(defined by a craniovertebral angle <50°). Participants received a standardized 5-minute sub-occipital release intervention. Key outcomes—pain(Numeric Pain Rating Scale), DNF activation(pressure biofeedback), and CVA(Kinovea software)—were assessed before and after the intervention.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Non-parametric analysis supported the findings related to pain and muscle activation. Following the intervention, the participants reported a notable improvement in pain reduction (p=0.0001) and DNF activation(p=0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant change in CVA(p=0.285).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>A single session of sub-occipital release significantly reduced neck pain and improved DNF activation in individuals with FHP. While the craniovertebral angle did not show immediate improvement, the technique shows promise as an early intervention for FHP management.

                    sContent: "<h3>ABSTRACT :</h3><div class='mt-0 line' /><p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Post-mastectomy lymphedema is a prevalent and distressing complication experienced by many breast cancer survivors. It typically results from disruption of lymphatic channels following axillary lymph node dissection or radiation therapy, leading to fluid accumulation, pain, and reduced upper limb function. Conventional physiotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment; however, complementary modalities such as kinesiological taping (KT) are emerging as promising non-invasive interventions to enhance lymphatic flow, reduce edema, and restore functional independence.</p><p><strong>CASE DESCRIPTION: </strong>A 52-year-old right-handed female, 8 weeks post-right-sided modified radical mastectomy for stage II invasive ductal carcinoma, presented to the physiotherapy department with complaints of heaviness, swelling, and restricted mobility in her right upper limb. Clinical examination revealed Grade II lymphedema with moderate pitting edema and shoulder range of motion (ROM) limitation. There were no signs of active infection or contraindications to physical therapy or taping. Her baseline Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was 58, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain was 6/10.</p><p><strong>INTERVENTION: </strong>A comprehensive rehabilitation program was designed, consisting of: Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD): Gentle, rhythmic massage to stimulate lymph flow, performed 5 times/week, Kinesiological Taping: Fan-cut KT strips were applied from distal to proximal limb to facilitate lymphatic return, replaced every 3–4 days, Range of Motion Exercises: Assisted and active ROM for shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation, Scapular Stabilization: Isometric and resistance band exercises targeting rhomboids, trapezius, and serratus anterior, Patient Education: On skin care, positioning, self-drainage techniques, and daily arm elevation. The treatment protocol was continued over a period of 6 weeks with regular monitoring. Outcomes: Marked improvements were observed in clinical parameters: Limb Circumference Reduction:, Mid-bicep: Reduced from 32 cm to 29 cm, Wrist: Reduced from 21.5 cm to 19 cm, Shoulder ROM Gains (Active Range), Flexion: 80° → 145°, Abduction: 60° → 135°, External Rotation: 30° → 70°, VAS Score: Reduced from 6/10 to 2/10, DASH Score: Improved from 58 to 22, Patient Feedback: Reported lighter limb sensation, reduced discomfort during dressing/grooming tasks, and improved self-esteem. No adverse effects or skin reactions were reported during the taping intervention.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>This case highlights the effective use of kinesiological taping as an adjunct to physiotherapy in managing post-mastectomy upper limb lymphedema. The lymphatic KT application technique, when combined with traditional manual and exercise therapies, contributed to measurable reductions in limb edema, improved upper limb mobility, and enhanced overall functional independence. KT is safe, economical, and easily applicable in outpatient settings, and its integration into post-breast cancer rehabilitation programs may offer additional therapeutic value.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Kinesiological taping, Post-mastectomy lymphedema, Breast cancer rehabilitation, Lymphatic drainage, Functional recovery, DASH score, Range of motion, Upper limb edema, Case report</p>",

Adolescents, due to high digital dependency, are at particular risk of cervical dysfunction. While the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) objectively evaluates ergonomic posture, the Neck Disability Index (NDI) quantifies self-perceived disability. Their combined utility in adolescent populations remains underexplored. b To compare outcomes of RULA and NDI in assessing ergonomic risk and functional disability related to TNS among adolescents in Gujarat, India.</p><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 97 undergraduate students (aged 18–25 years) with ≥2 hours/day smartphone use for at least six months. RULA scores were obtained from posture recordings during texting, while participants completed the NDI questionnaire in English or Gujarati. Descriptive statistics summarized demographic and outcome variables.

In India, the elderly population (60+) is expected to rise significantly, with those aged 70+ projected to increase from 27 million in 2001 to 132 million by 2050. A key age-related change is the decline in hand function due to muscle loss and reduced strength, particularly after 60 years. This study aimed to assess the effects of a 4-week neural tissue mobilization program on hand grip strength, nerve conduction, and dexterity in the 'young-old' population using the Jamar dynamometer, NCV test, and 9-hole peg board test.</p><p><strong>METHODOLOGY:</strong> The study included 25 subjects aged 60-75 years, with ethical clearance obtained. Participants were selected based on specific criteria and provided informed consent. Assessments included hand grip strength (Jamar dynamometer), dexterity (9-hole peg board test), and nerve conduction velocity (NCV apparatus). Neural tensioners were applied for 4 weeks, 3 times per week, with 6-8 oscillations, a 10-second hold, and 3 sets per nerve, allowing a 1-minute rest or until symptoms subsided. Pre- and post-intervention readings were recorded.</p><p><strong>RESULT:</strong> The study results showed significant post-intervention improvements in hand dexterity and grip strength, with slight enhancements in nerve conduction across all three nerves. The dominant hand exhibited greater improvement than the non-dominant hand. The findings suggest that neural tissue mobilization can effectively enhance grip strength, thereby improving dexterity and helping prevent hand function deterioration in the elderly.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This study concludes that neural tissue mobilization effectively enhances hand grip strength and dexterity in the young-old population. However, no significant improvement was observed in nerve conduction.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Elderly, Grip strength, Dexterity, NCV, Neural tissue mobilization.</p>",

Tightness in this muscle is commonly observed in individuals with poor posture, such as rounded shoulders and forward head posture, which may restrict thoracic cage movement and affect breathing efficiency. Among students, prolonged sitting, use of electronic devices, and poor ergonomics can contribute to postural imbalances and increased muscle tightness. Since effective thoracic expansion is crucial for optimal breathing, it is important to investigate whether pectoralis minor tightness affects lung function and chest wall mobility. Understanding this relationship can aid in developing integrated musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation strategies.</p><p><strong>Objective: </strong>The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between pectoralis minor tightness and inspiratory capacity, and to evaluate its relationship with thoracic expansion measured at the axilla, nipple, and xiphoid levels in healthy student participants.</p><p><strong>Methods: </strong>Eighty-five healthy students participated in the study. Pectoralis minor tightness was assessed using a standardized length test. Inspiratory capacity was measured using an incentive volumetric spirometer, and thoracic expansion was measured at three anatomical levels using a measuring tape. Pearson’s correlation test was used for analysis.</p><p><strong>Results: </strong>There was a modest, non-significant link between pectoralis minor tightness and thoracic expansion, but a substantial moderate correlation with inspiratory capacity (r = 0.309, p = 0.004). At the axillary level, there was a weak and negative correlation between thoracic expansion and pectoralis minor tension (r = – 0.194, p = 0.075).At the nipple level, there was a weak and statistically insignificant correlation between pectoralis minor tightness and thoracic expansion (r = 0.006, p = 0.956).

Smartphone addiction occurs when people use their phones excessively and cannot control their use, leading to problems in their daily lives and relationships. College students are at a higher risk because they depend heavily on smartphones for studying, socializing, and entertainment. High usage rates have been correlated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, decreased academic performance, and musculoskeletal issues. This is especially concerning among populations where physical and mental health are essential, such as healthcare students. Physiotherapy students may be particularly affected because they need to stay physically and mentally healthy to become good healthcare providers.</p><p><strong>Objective: </strong>To determine whether the screen time threshold is linked to an increased risk and to investigate the relationship between daily screen time and the degree of smartphone addiction among physiotherapy students.</p><p><strong>Methods: </strong>A cross-sectional study was conducted among 236 physiotherapy students (aged 17–24 years) in Gujarat, India. Smartphone addiction was assessed using the Smartphone Addiction Scale–Short Version (SAS-SV), and screen time was objectively tracked using built-in monitoring applications. Descriptive statistics, Pearson and Spearman correlations, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc testing, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed.</p><p><strong>Results: </strong>Participants reported a mean daily screen time of 4.74 ± 2.22 hours (range 0.2–19.0) and mean SAS-SV scores of 28.13 ± 9.25 (range 10–55). A weak but statistically significant positive correlation was found between screen time and smartphone addiction (Pearson’s r = 0.173, p = 0.008; Spearman’s ρ = 0.133, p = 0.041). Students with >6 hours/day of screen time (11.0% of the sample) showed significantly higher addiction scores (31.8 ± 11.1) than their peers with ≤6 hours/day (27.6 ± 8.8, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d ≈ 0.46). ROC analysis identified six hours/day as a practical threshold for high-risk addiction, with an AUC of 0.68</p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Daily screen time was positively associated with smartphone addiction severity among physiotherapy students. Screen use exceeding six hours/day represents a critical risk marker, highlighting the need for targeted preventive strategies and the integration of digital wellness into healthcare education.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> smartphone addiction, screen time, physiotherapy students, Smartphone Addiction Scale, digital wellness, behavioral health</p>",

The control group participated in standard rehabilitation practices, which primarily focused on improving general mobility, stretching, and balance training. Posture was evaluated using a combination of objective and subjective measures, including the Postural Control Assessment (PCA), and the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS). The results revealed statistically significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group.

This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of knee joint traction as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy in 30-40 patients aged 40-70 years with radiologically confirmed knee OA. Participants were allocated to either an experimental group receiving combined traction (continuous or intermittent) and conventional therapy or a control group receiving conventional therapy alone. Outcomes including pain (VAS), functional mobility (WOMAC), knee range of motion (goniometry), and psychological status (BDI) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results demonstrated that the traction group exhibited significantly greater improvements in pain reduction, functional capacity, and joint mobility compared to controls, with continuous traction proving particularly effective for alleviating stiffness and enhancing physical performance. Additionally, traction therapy yielded psychological benefits, including reduced depressive symptoms. The optimal therapeutic effect was observed at 60°- 90° of knee flexion. These findings suggest that knee joint traction represents a safe and clinically beneficial intervention for managing knee OA, though further large-scale research is warranted to establish standardized treatment protocols and confirm long-term efficacy. This study contributes to the growing evidence supporting mechanical traction as a valuable component in the multimodal management of knee osteoarthritis.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Knee osteoarthritis, knee joint traction, continuous traction, intermittent traction, pain management, functional mobility, range of motion, physiotherapy, WOMAC, VAS, depression, quality of life.</p>",

While both High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Low-Intensity Interval Training (LIIT) are widely implemented in athletic conditioning, their distinct impacts on sprinter performance remain unexplored. HIIT involves short bursts of maximal effort followed by recovery and is employed during intensive training blocks. LIIT consists of longer, moderate- intensity intervals with minimal rest, often used during recovery periods.Study provides evidence regarding HIIT and LIIT for sprinters.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the effect of HIIT and LIIT on muscular endurance, strength, speed, and flexibility in trained sprinters.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and The Cochrane Collaboration. Ten studies were initially identified, out of which five met the inclusion criteria and were selected for detailed analysis. The focus was on studies evaluating sprint-specific outcomes following HIIT and LIIT interventions.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> HIIT interventions demonstrated significant improvements in anaerobic power, sprint speed, and muscular strength. LIIT showed enhancements in aerobic endurance and flexibility. The contrasting mechanisms of protocols support their individual benefits, HIIT as an effective strategy for high-intensity performance gains, and LIIT as a supportive recovery tool promoting sustained conditioning.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> HIIT and LIIT serves essential and complementary roles for sprinters. HIIT is more effective in boosting anaerobic capabilities and explosive performance, while LIIT supports recovery, flexibility, and endurance. A strategic combination of these training offers a balanced approach to optimizing overall sprint performance.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> High-Intensity Interval Training, Low-Intensity Interval Training, Sprint Performance</p>",

Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES), commercially known as Phagenyx, has emerged as a neurostimulation approach for treating neurogenic dysphagia via sensory-driven neuroplasticity mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To systematically evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient-reported outcomes of PES for treating neurogenic dysphagia across diverse clinical populations and provide comprehensive evidence synthesis for clinical decision-making.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> A comprehensive systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, searching electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) from inception to September 2024. We included randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and economic evaluations investigating PES for neurogenic dysphagia. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias assessment revealed moderate to high concerns due to inadequate blinding and selective outcome reporting issues. Small randomized controlled trials demonstrated improved decannulation rates (75% vs. 20%, p<0.01) and reduced pneumonia events in selected populations, while the largest multicenter trial (n=162) showed no significant improvement in primary swallowing endpoints. Meta-analyses reported modest within-subject improvements but inconsistent between-group effects. Cost-effectiveness data were critically limited, with no published economic evaluations that met the quality standards.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Current evidence demonstrates mixed efficacy with modest benefits in selected populations but lacks robust evidence of clinically meaningful improvements in aspiration pneumonia or quality of life. High-quality, adequately powered trials with standardized protocols, comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses, and patient-reported outcomes are required before widespread clinical adoption. The evidence suggests that PES may offer benefits in some swallowing measures and nasogastric tube removal, particularly in tracheotomized patients, but direct evidence for pneumonia reduction remains limited.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Electrical Stimulation, Dysphagia</p>",

A number of factors can affect foot posture during this period of fast growth and increased activity. Foot posture assessment in Geriatric is essential for identifying abnormal alignment patterns that can affect gait, balance, and risk of future musculoskeletal issues. During this stage of rapid growth and increased activity foot posture can be influenced by several factors. Elder population are more prone to pronation due to ligamentous laxity, with corrections expected as they age, but many retain non-neutral posture. Gender differences are observed, with females often showing a higher prevalence of pronated posture, likely due to anatomical and physiological variables. BMI also plays a significant role- underweight populations tend to have increased pronation, possibly from reduced muscle and tissue support in the feet, highlighting the importance of health in foot posture.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> This is a cross- sectional observational study was carried out on Varkari Community Camp. The study involved 300 healthy varkaris both male and female participated in the study.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The result show that pronated foot posture is predominant among elderly, making up the majority cases, Females and Underweight were more likely to have pronation, while neutral posture was rare.

This misalignment increases cervical loading, leading to pain, restricted motion, and reduced functional ability. Physiotherapeutic interventions such as the Kendall Exercise Program and Scapular Stabilization Exercises (SSE) are widely used to restore postural balance and reduce neck discomfort.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of Kendall Exercises and Scapular Stabilization Exercises in improving cervical alignment, reducing pain, and enhancing functional performance among individuals with Forward Head Posture.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> A comparative experimental study was conducted on 34 participants aged 20–45 years diagnosed with FHP. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: Group A (Kendall Exercises, n = 17) and Group B (SSE, n = 17). Both groups received conventional physiotherapy along with their respective exercise interventions three times per week for four weeks. Outcome measures included the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Craniovertebral Angle (CVA), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). Pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests with a significance level set at p < 0.05.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in all outcome measures (p = 0.001). Between-group analysis revealed that the Kendall group demonstrated greater improvement in CVA (p = 0.02) and pain reduction (p = 0.026), while NDI improvement was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.073).</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Both exercise programs effectively improved posture, reduced pain, and enhanced functional ability in individuals with FHP. However, Kendall Exercises proved more effective in restoring cervical alignment and reducing pain, suggesting their superiority for targeted correction of Forward Head Posture.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Forward Head Posture, Kendall Exercise, Scapular Stabilization Exercise, Neck Pain, Postural Correction, Craniovertebral Angle</p>",

                    sContent: "<h3>ABSTRACT :</h3><div class='mt-0 line' /><p><strong>Background:</strong> Trunk control and balance are critical factors for functional independence in stroke patients. Among stroke survivors, up to 80% experience impairments in trunk control and balance, which are crucial for functional independence and activities of daily living (ADLs). While both task-oriented and core exercise training are commonly used in rehabilitation, their comparative effects on improving trunk control and balance remain unclear.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> The research aimed to bridge the gap by investigating the effect of task-oriented versus core exercise training on trunk control ability and balance in stroke patients.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> This study was conducted to compare the effects of task-oriented training and core strengthening exercises on trunk control and balance in stroke patients. Participants aged 45–60 years with a first-ever ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (3 months to 1 year duration), and an MMSE score ≥24, were recruited through purposive sampling from a clinical rehabilitation center. Eligible participants (n=30) were randomly allocated into two groups using simple randomization.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The present study demonstrated that participants in Group A (Task-Oriented Training) showed a highly significant improvement in balance as measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), with a mean increase of 13.7 points from pre- to post-intervention, indicating a strong effect of the intervention. In contrast, Group B (Core Strengthening Exercises) showed a moderate yet statistically significant improvement in BBS, with a 6.0-point increase. Regarding trunk control measured through the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Group B demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of 2.9 points (P = 0.037) whereas Group A improved by 3.3 points, but this change was not statistically significant (P = 0.23). These findings suggest that task-oriented training is particularly effective for improving balance, while core strengthening may be more beneficial for trunk control in stroke patients.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Task-oriented training was found to be more effective in enhancing dynamic balance, as it involves functional movements that closely mimic real-life activities, thereby fostering neuroplasticity and improving postural control. This supports the growing body of literature on the importance of task-specific training in stroke rehabilitation. On the other hand, core strengthening exercises demonstrated a marked improvement in trunk control, a crucial factor for stabilizing posture and enhancing functional mobility.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Stroke Rehabilitation, Task-Oriented Training, Core Strengthening Exercises, Trunk Control, Balance Berg Balance Scale (BBS),Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS).</p>",

                    sContent: "<h3>ABSTRACT :</h3><div class='mt-0 line' /><p><strong>Background:</strong> Forward Head Posture (FHP) is a postural deviation where the lower neck (C4-C7) bends forward while the upper neck (C1-C3) and head extend backward, creating an exaggerated inward curve. This posture limits diaphragmatic expansion, reducing lung function by restricting breathing mechanics. Accessory muscles are recruited, rib cage mobility is reduced, and diaphragmatic ventilation is impaired, leading to decreased alveolar ventilation.</p><p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The aim of the study is to investigate the association between Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) and Forward head Posture.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in Ahmedabad involving 100 young adults aged 18-25 years who voluntarily participated. Individuals with orthopaedic, major neurological, and cardio-respiratory disorders were excluded. Participants exhibiting forward head posture were assessed by measuring their cranio-vertebral angle (CVA). PEFR was measured three times using a peak flow meter. As it requires effort, the highest value was used for analysis.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Participants (mean age 21.46±2.19 years, mean BMI 23.33±4.41). Significant association was found between PEFR, CV angle (rho=0.325, p<0.001) and BMI (rho=0.323, p<0.001). No association was found between CV angle and BMI (rho=0.118, p=0.244). Data were analyzed using SPSS v20 with a 5% significance level, employing the Spearman correlation test.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A strong association was observed between PEFR and both CV angle and BMI in young adults. These findings suggest that postural assessment can help predict respiratory function and support integrating posture correction into respiratory care and rehabilitation.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Forward Head Posture, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate, Cranio-Vertebral Angle, Young Adults</p>",

Atherosclerosis is defined as the accumulation of lipid plaques in artery walls, resulting in constriction, rigidity, and potential obstructions that increase the risk of myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. In severe cases, cardiovascular diseases may require surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Post-operative rehabilitation is crucial, especially for patients recovering after CABG, to improve results and avert problems. In this study, the use of respiratory muscle stretch gymnastics (RMSG) into rehabilitation programs following CABG is investigated. The findings demonstrate that RMSG can significantly improve lung function, reduce surgical complications, and hasten the healing process. To confirm these benefits and evaluate their long-term impacts, more research is needed with larger, more diverse patient groups and longer follow-up periods.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong> A total of 54 postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting patients were included in the study.

This study aimed to compare the effects of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, and Odissi training on pulmonary function in adults aged 30 to 59 years. A total of sixty trained dancers, with 20 in each group and a minimum of one year of practice at least twice weekly, were recruited. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) was measured using a peak flow meter, while cardiopulmonary reserve was assessed by the Breath Holding Test (BHT). Data normality was examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and intergroup comparisons were performed using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. The results demonstrated significant differences in PEFR (H = 7.268, p = 0.026) and BHT (p < 0.001) across the three groups, with Odissi dancers achieving the highest values, followed by Bharatanatyam and Kathak. These findings indicate that variations in breathing techniques and movement intensity among dance forms influence pulmonary outcomes. In conclusion, Odissi and Bharatanatyam appear more effective than Kathak in enhancing respiratory efficiency.

                    sContent: "<h3>ABSTRACT :</h3><div class='mt-0 line' /><p><strong>Background:</strong> Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder and a leading cause of disability globally. Prolapsed intervertebral disc (PIVD) is a major structural contributor to LBP, causing localized pain, radiating symptoms, and functional limitations. Chefs are at high risk due to prolonged standing, repetitive bending, lifting, and awkward postures in confined kitchen spaces, which increase lumbar disc stress and degeneration. Despite this, limited data exist on PIVD prevalence in chefs, particularly in India.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the prevalence of PIVD among chefs with LBP, assess associated disability, and identify occupational risk factors.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> A cross-sectional study included 43 professional chefs from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, recruited via convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria were LBP with or without radiculopathy, positive clinical signs on Straight Leg Raise (SLR) or Slump Test, and ≥4–5 hours of daily kitchen work. Exclusion criteria included prior spinal surgery, systemic or non-PIVD causes of pain, and neurological red flags. Participants underwent SLR and Slump Tests, and completed the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to evaluate functional impairment. Data were analyzed using SPSS v25; p < 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Participants had a mean age of 41.95 ± 4.41 years; 53.48% were female. Radiating pain was reported by 93.02%. SLR positivity was observed in 39.53% and Slump Test positivity in 20.93%. ODI scores indicated severe disability in 55.81% and crippled status in 9.3%. A significant correlation was found between pain duration and disability severity (p = 0.001), with longer pain associated with higher functional limitations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> PIVD is prevalent among chefs with LBP, particularly in those with prolonged pain and higher disability. Early screening, ergonomic modifications, posture education, and physiotherapy interventions are critical to prevent progression to chronic disability.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Low Back Pain (LBP), Prolapsed Intervertebral Disc (PIVD), chefs, occupational health, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Straight Leg Raise (SLR) Test, Slump Test</p>",

One-mile treadmill walk test (1MTWT) is a commonly used exercise test. For submaximal exercise testing, the ambient temperature is a crucial factor that has to be well monitored. fitness tests should ideally be conducted in controlled environments for accuracy; this practice is not widely implemented due to practical challenges.</p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Aim of the study is to evaluate the physiological cost index(PCI), one-minute heart rate-recovery(HRR1), and perceived exertion(RPE) after 1MTWT at two different temperatures, comparing their effects on college students.</p><p><strong>Methods:</strong> An observational crossover study on 11 college going students was conducted after obtaining verbal consent and explaining the procedure. Each Student performed the 1MWT on treadmill in two different ambient temperature environments-(1)Room with air-conditioner plus fan (2)Room without air-conditioner or fan. Post-testing, PCI, RPE, and one-minute heart rate recovery (HRR1) were measured. PCI and RPE across two ambient temperatures were analyzed using paired t-tests, while HRR1 was compared using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Significantly higher PCI (p < 0.048), RPE(p<0.001) and lower HRR1 (z<0.003) in room without Air-conditioner or Fan vs with Air-conditioner plus Fan trials.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is significant effect of ambient temperature on PCI, HRR1 and RPE following a 1MTWT.
