                sContent: '<h3>INTRODUCTION: -</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>An epidemic of lower back pain affects millions of individuals globally. One significant cause of this pain stems from disc problems in the lumbar spine, such as disc herniations, degeneration, or nerve impingement. To accurately diagnose these disc issues, healthcare professionals rely on various physical assessments. Among the most reliable tests is the Slump Test.</p><h3>What is the Slump Test?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a physical examination technique used to assess neural tension, particularly in the lumbar spine. It’s often employed by physiotherapists, chiropractors, and physicians to evaluate nerve root compression or disc pathologies. When someone has pain radiating from their lower back into the legs, known as sciatica, the Slump Test can provide valuable insights into whether a lumbar disc problem is the source of the pain.</p><p>Why is the Slump Test Important for Lumbar Spine Disc Diseases? Disc diseases in the lumbar spine, such as herniated or bulging discs, can compress the spinal nerves. This compression leads to a range of symptoms, including pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, particularly down the legs. The Slump Test helps in pinpointing the source of these symptoms, especially when they are related to nerve involvement due to disc displacement.</p><p>The test mimics a slouched posture, which stretches the spinal cord and nerve roots. If a disc problem exists, this stretch aggravates the pain or discomfort, confirming the involvement of lumbar disc issues.</p><h3>How is the Slump Test Performed?</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is typically done in a clinical setting. Here’s how it works:<br /><ul><li><p>Patient Position: The patient sits on the edge of the examination table with their thighs supported, knees flexed, and feet dangling.</p></li><li><p>Posture Slumping: The patient is asked to slump or round their back while keeping their head upright. This posture places stress on the spinal structures.</p></li><li><p>Neck Flexion: The patient is then instructed to flex their neck by bringing the chin toward the chest.</p></li><li><p>Leg Extension: With the patient in this slumped position, one leg is slowly extended by the clinician, which stretches the sciatic nerve and the nerve roots in the lumbar spine.</p></li><li><p>Response Assessment: The patient is asked if they feel any reproduction of their symptoms, such as pain, numbness, or tingling down the leg. If so, it indicates the likelihood of lumbar nerve root irritation, often due to a disc herniation or other disc pathology.</p></li></ul></p><h3>Interpretation of Results:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Positive Test: If the patient experiences a reproduction of their typical symptoms, particularly sciatica-like pain, while performing the test, it’s considered a positive result. This strongly suggests neural involvement due to lumbar disc issues.</p><p>Negative Test: If the patient does not experience any symptoms or discomfort, the result is negative. This could indicate that the disc is not the cause of the pain, or that the symptoms are stemming from other sources like muscular tension or joint dysfunction.</p><h3>Clinical Relevance of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a useful tool in diagnosing lumbar disc problems because it reproduces the mechanical stresses that occur when the lumbar spine’s nerve roots are irritated. It provides valuable direction to clinicians in determining the next steps for treatment, including physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustments, or even more invasive interventions like injections or surgery.</p><h3>Limitations of the Slump Test:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>Although the Slump Test is valuable, it’s not the only tool for diagnosing lumbar disc disease. It must be combined with other assessments such as:</p><p>MRI or CT scans to confirm disc herniations or degenerations. Range of motion tests to rule out joint-related issues. Reflex testing to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement. Additionally, the Slump Test is a subjective test based on the patient’s response, so it requires skilled interpretation from the clinician.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><hr class="mt-0" /><p>The Slump Test is a crucial direction-providing test in diagnosing disc diseases of the lumbar spine. It helps clinicians assess nerve root compression due to disc herniation or bulging, which is often the source of lower back pain radiating down the legs. As part of a comprehensive physical assessment, the Slump Test can offer clear guidance for treatment strategies, ultimately helping patients recover from lumbar spine issues and regain their quality of life.</p><p>For anyone experiencing lower back pain or sciatica-like symptoms, consult a healthcare provider to assess the possibility of disc-related problems using diagnostic tools like the Slump Test. Early detection can lead to more effective treatments and a quicker recovery.</p>'

However, the risk of injuries is always present due to the high-intensity nature of the game. To address this issue, FIFA developed the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program, aimed at reducing the risk of injuries among soccer players of all levels.</p><p>The FIFA 11+ program consists of a series of exercises designed to improve strength, balance, agility, and flexibility while also targeting key risk factors for injuries, such as incorrect movement patterns and muscle imbalances. By incorporating these exercises into their regular training routine, players can significantly reduce their chances of sustaining common injuries like muscle strains, ligament tears, and sprains.</p><p>The FIFA 11+ program emphasizes dynamic stretching and muscle activation exercises to prepare the body for soccer matches, increasing flexibility, improving proprioception, and reducing injury risk.</p><p>In addition to the physical benefits, the FIFA 11+ program also emphasizes the importance of good technique and proper body mechanics to prevent injuries. By teaching players how to move efficiently and safely on the field, the program helps reduce the risk of overuse injuries and repetitive strain.</p><p>Overall, the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program is effective in reducing the incidence of injuries among soccer players. By incorporating this program into their training regimen, players can improve their performance on the field while also safeguarding against the physical toll that the sport can take on their bodies. Whether you&#39;re a professional athlete or a casual player, following the FIFA 11+ program can help keep you healthy, strong, and injury-free while playing the beautiful game of soccer.</p>'

According to research, elderly men&#39;s and women&#39;s immunological responses to influenza vaccine vary significantly.</p><p>Hormonal differences between men and women have a significant role in these discrepancies. Estrogen, which is found in greater amounts in women, has been demonstrated to improve immunological response to vaccinations, particularly flu injections. According to studies, women may have a stronger immunological response to vaccination than males because of hormonal influences.</p><p>Furthermore, age-related immune system changes, known as immunosenescence, influence how older people respond to immunizations. In general, older persons have a weakened immune system, which leads to a worse response to vaccination. However, research suggests that women may maintain greater immune function as they age than males, perhaps leading to a more effective response to flu vaccines.</p><p>In addition, variations in the way older men and women react to flu vaccines might be attributed to hereditary factors. It is known that individual reactions to vaccination are influenced by differences in genes linked to immune function and vaccine response. Variations in vaccination effectiveness between older men and women have been identified; these discrepancies may be partially explained by genetic differences.</p><p>In summary, whereas vaccinations against influenza protect against the disease for older men and women alike, there are notable variations in the immune responses of these populations. Comprehending these distinctions is crucial for refining vaccination plans for senior citizens and creating specialized methods to increase vaccination efficacy in this demographic.</p>'

Poor core strength is considered to be one of the leading causes of low back pain and injuries associated with sport specific performances. The aim of this study was to establish whether there was a significant difference in the lumbar core strength of skaters, when compared to that of age matched non-skaters. Measures should be taken towards achieving a good core strength as a pre-emptive as well as a curative step against low back pain, among skater and the general population not participating in any sport specific performance</p><p>Aims & Objectives: This study sought to assess and compare the lumbar core strength of skaters and non-skaters. Study design: Observational study</p><p>Methodology: A total of 100 participants were selected, 50 skaters and 50 non-skaters, between the ages of 15 to 25 years. The skaters were those who had a minimum of 1 year training without any complaints of low back pain, fracture, etc. and non-skaters were individuals who did not participate in any other form of training. The pressure bio-feedback method was explained to all the participants. Their consent was obtained. The core strength of the participants was then assessed and compared using Unpaired t-Test in Microsoft excel 2007.</p><p>Results: After comparing the data, it was found that the mean core strength of the skaters (case group) was 6.12 ± 1.99, and that of the non-skaters (control group) was 4.56 ± 2.28. The p value obtained was 0.00, which implied that there was a significant difference between the two groups, with the case group having greater core strength value.</p><p>Conclusion: Thus, it was found that, statistically, the lumbar core muscle strength of the case group i.e. skaters was significantly more than that of the control group i.e. non-skaters.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Lumbar core, strength, skaters, adolescence, adult</p>",

Although it seems reasonable that even minor biomechanical alterations in the support surface may influence postural-control strategies. Flexible flatfoot is defined as the postural appearance of the foot, with depressed medial longitudinal arch, pronated subtalar joint and the calcaneus assuming a valgus position underweight bearing conditions. The term “flexible” means that while the foot is flat when standing (weightbearing), the arch returns when not standing. Dynamic balance is the ability of an object to balance while in motion. Y balance test is useful tool to measure dynamic balance which measures dynamic balance in three different directions, anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral direction.</p><p>Method: 10 subjects with bilateral flexible flat feet as assessed by sit to stand navicular drop test and 10 subjects with normal arched feet both in the age group 18-25 years were chosen for the study. The sample size therefore was 40 feet (20 flat feet and 20 normal arched feet). Group A (n= 10) subjects was individuals with flatfeet and group B (n= 10) subjects was individuals with normal arched feet. All the subjects were asked to perform Y – Balance test. Subjects were asked to keep their non-testing leg on the center of the grid. Subjects was asked to reach in all three directions (anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral) by great toe of testing leg as much as he can. Distance covered by the subjects in all three direction was recorded. Then same procedure was repeated for another leg. Data analysis was done by the Unpaired -'t' test using SPSS software version 20.</p><p>Result: There was no significant difference found between flatfeet and normal arched feet.</p><p>Conclusion: Dynamic balance is not affected in flat feet individuals.</p><p>KEYWORDS: Dynamic balance; Flat feet; Sit to stand navicular drop test; Y- balance test.</p>",

The attacks are accompanied by salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, nasal mucosa congestion, skin redness, facial swelling and/or contraction of the muscles acting on jaw. It is also characterized by regions of increased arousal, called trigger zones.There is gamut of medical and surgical treatment modalities available for trigeminal neuralgia, with other treatment methods like physiotherapy, acupuncture and psychological methods.5To control pain in patients with TN,carbamazepine should be offered and oxcarbazepine,baclofen,lamotrigine and pimozide may be considered6Physiotherapy is one of the methods to treat TN ,pain control is usually achieved by means of electrical stimulation .The two currents most often used to achieve this intention are pulsed current usually referred as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS) and burst modulated medium frequency alternating current in the form of interferential current(IFC). Efficacy of TENS and IFC on Trigeminal Neuralgia have been studied separately but studies on comparison are not available. So present study was taken up with the purpose of comparing efficacy of TENS and IFC on trigeminal neuralgia Both TENS and IFC has significant efficacy in case of Trigeminal Neuralgia when studied separately.

In this study, attitudes& perceptions of students pursuing their Bachelors in Physiotherapy in two urban cities of Maharashtra have been studied and their views regarding choosing physiotherapy as a career highlighted; as they are the best ones to judge this rather than other professionals doing it for them. There is no doubt that Physiotherapy as a course, career and even as a profession is scaling new heights & reaching peaks.</p><p>Aims & Objectives: This study sought to assess the attitude and beliefs of Bachelors of PT students regarding the future of their profession in India.</p><p>Study design: Questionnaire based survey</p><p>Methodology: A self prepared questionnaire & Google docs format of the questionnaire was distributed to 9Physiotherapy colleges in Pune & Mumbai. The sample size was 737. The questionnaire consisted of 14 single best response MCQs.</p><p>Results: After analyzing the data received, it was seen that 87% students decided to study physiotherapy after their low medical entrance exam scores. 76% also sought advice from professional career counselors before choosing PT. Students also believed that this field has its disadvantages and not many were aware about the job opportunities in & around their state. Students appeared to have a mixed opinion about whether licensing exam should be compulsory before practicing physiotherapy in India.</p><p>Conclusion: Awareness about physiotherapy as a career is increasing but still needs to be worked upon mainly at school levels and amongst the general population.

At a higher level game, being a fast paced sport Badminton demands excellent fitness, aerobic stamina, strength, speed and precision. Playing Badminton also requires good agility, cardiovascular endurance, strength and reaction time. Reaction time is the amount of time taken to respond to a stimulus. It can be improved by practice as it affects the quality of game. Every player and healthcare professionals need to analyze the technique and requirement of the sport in order to modulate the coaching accordingly.</p><p>Aim: To find if there is a correlation between upper extremity muscles strength of dominant hand and reaction time in competitive badminton players.</p><p>Material and Method: Isometric muscle strength of pectoralis major, shoulder rotators, triceps, deltoid, wrist flexors and extensor were assessed using the hand-held dynamometer (FET3) and the reaction time was assessed by audiovisual reaction time machine for competitive badminton players. The average age was 18.77 (± 2.75) years. Both the parameters were correlated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient test using Microsoft Excel 2007.</p><p>Result: A negative moderate correlation was found between the upper extremity muscle strength and reaction time.

The relationship among these factors with neck pain was examined.</p><p>Results: The study indicated high prevalence rate of non-specific chronic neck pain (51.7%). Neck pain was strongly associated with functional disability in surgeons (p= 0.000). Stress factors were associated with functional disabilities in surgeons (p=0.000).</p><p>Conclusion: These results indicate that non-specific chronic neck pain does affect the functional disability in surgeons. Strong association of stress factors on the functional disabilities in surgeons was confirmed, while associated factors don’t contribute to the functional disabilities in surgeons. There is high recommendation of urgent ergonomic attention and physiotherapeutic awareness for the future.</p><p>Keywords: non-specific chronic neck pain; perceived stress; functional disability</p>",

Even small improvements in the areas of mobility, balance, and gait may contribute valuable benefits in terms of quality of life. Footwear, being at the interface between the body and the supporting surface, has the potential to affect balance and subsequently, the risk of falling. Hence the purpose of this study was to evaluate the balance & gait while wearing different type of footwear using functional reach test (FRT), time up and go test(TUG) and 10 meter walk test(10 MWT).</p><p>Subjects: 50 older males aged between 60-80 years.</p><p>Method: Demographic data, brief history and characteristics of different type of footwear were recorded. Each subjects performed FRT, TUG and MWT while barefoot, walking shoe and usual footwear (slipper). Each subject had performed all 3 tests without any difficulty. Three trials were given for each test and average of three trials was noted by therapist. One way repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analysis were done by SPSS.</p><p>Results: One way repeated measure ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between each footwear condition for all 3 tests. Post-hoc analysis revealed that walking shoes were having significant superior score than the barefoot & usual footwear for all 3 tests.</p><p>Conclusion: Walking shoes improve balance and gait in older males. Walking shoes also provide shock absorption and allow people to walk faster without increasing the impact loading of the body. So Footwear intervention should be considered as a way of improving gait and balance in older males.</p><p>Keywords: Different footwear; Balance; Gait.</p>",

Therefore, innovative rehabilitation programs are preferred. This study aims to check the effect of RehabRelive Active glove therapy in improving hand function in stroke survivors. A prospective, interventional study was conducted in patients with subacute and chronic stroke patients. 24 participants were allocated to the experimental group or the control group. The experiment group underwent 45 minutes of conventional physical therapy plus 15 minutes of glove therapy, and 5 minutes of conventional hand treatment. The control group underwent 45 minutes of conventional physical therapy plus 20 minutes of conventional hand therapy. All participants underwent each intervention 4 days/week for four weeks. They were evaluated before and 4 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the change in the score of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (wrist and hand component) and the secondary outcome measures were the box and block test, and Chedoke arm and hand activity inventory. Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was applied to compare the outcome measures of both groups. Results of this study showed that RehabRelive glove therapy showed improvement in all outcome measures, which confirms the efficacy of glove therapy. However, there is no statistically significant difference found in comparison of the intervention group with the control group. RehabRelive active glove therapy is feasible, safe, and without adverse effects, providing an entertaining approach to rehabilitation.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> RehabRelive Active Glove, Conventional therapy, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, Hand dexterity</p>",
